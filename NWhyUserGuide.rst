Overview
========
		NWhy is a C++-based, scalable, high-performance hypergraph library. It has three dependencies.
		It uses NWGraph library as the building block. NWGraph provides graph data structures, a rich set of adaptors over the graph data structures, various high-performance graph algorithms implementations.
		It relies Intel OneAPI Threading Building Blocks (oneTBB) to provide parallelism.
		To expose the C++ implementations to Python, Pybind11 are adopted to encapsulate NWhy as a python module.
		The goal of the NWhy python APIs is to share a ID space between NWhy and its user for hypergraph processing, instead of copying the sparse matrix of the hypergraph back and forth between NWhy and its user.
		NWhy is developed by Xu Tony Liu. The current version is preliminary and under active development.

NWHypergraph class attribues
----------------------------

	NWHypergraph.row
		Attribute in class NWHypergraph. 
		Return a Numpy array of IDs, row of sparse matrix of the hypergraph. Note the number of entries in the Numpy lists, row, col and data must be equal. The row stores hyperedges.
	NWHypergraph.col

NWHypergraph class methods
--------------------------

	NWHypergraph.NWHypergraph(x, y)
		Constructor of class NWHypergraph.
		Return a NWHypergraph object. Here the hypergraph is unweighted. X is a Numpy array of hyperedges, and y is a Numpy array of vertices.

	NWHypergraph.NWHypergraph(x, y, data)
		Constructor of class NWHypergraph.
		Return a NWHypergraph object. Here the hypergraph is weighted. X is a Numpy array of hyperedges, y is a Numpy array of vertices, data is a Numpy array of weights associated with the pairs from hyperedges to vertices.

	NWHypergraph.collapse_edges(return_equal_class=False)
		Method in class NWHypergraph.
		Return a dictionary, where the key is a new ID of a hyperedge after collapsing the hyperedges if the hyperedges have the same vertices, and the value is the number of such hyperedges when `return_equal_class=False`, otherwise, the set of such hyperedges when `return_equal_class=True`. Note the weights associated with the pairs from hyperedges to vertices are not collapsed or combined.

	NWHypergraph.collapse_nodes(return_equal_class=False)
		Method in class NWHypergraph.	
		Return a dictionary, where the key is a new ID of a vertex after collapsing the vertices if the vertices share the same hyperedges, and the value is the number of such vertices when `return_equal_class=False`, otherwise, the set of such vertices when `return_equal_class=True`. Note the weights associated with the pairs from hyperedges to vertices are not collapsed or combined.

	NWHypergraph.collapse_nodes_and_edges(return_equal_class=False)
		Method in class NWHypergraph.
		Return a dictionary, where the key is a new ID of a hyperedge after collapsing the hyperedges if the hyperedges share the same vertices, and the value is the number of such hyperedges when `return_equal_class=False`, otherwise, the set of such hyperedges when `return_equal_class=True`. This method is not equivalent to call `NWHypergraph.collapse_nodes()` then `NWHypergraph.collapse_edges()`. Note the weights associated with the pairs from hyperedges to vertices are not collapsed or combined.

	NWHypergraph.edge_size_dist()
		Method in class NWHypergraph.
		Return a list of edge size distribution of the hypergraph.

	NWHypergraph.toplexes()
		Method in class NWHypergraph.
		Return a list of toplexes in the hypergraph. For a hypergraph (Edges, Nodes), a toplex is a hyperedge in Edges whose elements (i.e. nodes) do not all belong to any other hyperedge in Edge.

	NWHypergraph.s_linegraph(s=1, edges=True)

		Return a Slinegraph object. Construct a s-line graph from the hypergraph for a positive integer `s`. In this s-line graph, the vertices are the hyperedges in the original hypergraph if `edges=True`; otherwise, the vertices are the vertices in the original hypergraph. Note this method create s-line graph on the fly, therefore it requires less memory compared with `NWHypergraph.s_linegraphs(l, edges=True)`. It is slower to construct multiple s-line graphs for different `s` compared with `NWHypergraph.s_linegraphs(l, edges=True)`.

	NWHypergraph.s_linegraphs(l, edges=True)
		Method in class NWHypergraph.
		Return a list of Slinegraph objects. For each positive integer in list `l`, construct a Slinegraph object from the hypergraph. In each s-line graph, the vertices are the hyperedges in the original hypergraph if `edges=True`; otherwise, the vertices are the vertices in the original hypergraph. Note this method creates multiple s-line graphs for one run, therefore it is significantly faster compared with `NWHypergraph.s_linegraph(s=1, edges=True)`, but it requires much more memory.


Slinegraph class
----------------

	Slinegraph

		The base class for s-line graph representation in nwhy. It store an undirected graph, called an s-line graph of a hypergraph given a positive integer s. Slinegraph can be an 'edge' line graph, where the vertices in Slinegraph are the hyperedges in the original hypergraph; Slinegraph can also be a 'vertex' line graph, where the vertices in Slinegraph are the vertices in the original hypergraph.

Slinegraph class attribues
--------------------------
		
	Slinegraph.row
		Attribute in class Slinegraph.

Currently, if Slinegraph is an edge line graph, the weights are the number of overlapping vertices between two hyperedges in the original hypergraph. If the Slinegraph is a vertex line graph, the weights are the number of overlapping hyperedges between two vertices in the original hypergraph.
	Slinegraph.s

    	.. math::

        	C(v) = \frac{n - 1}{\sum_{v=1}^{n-1} d(u, v)},
